# City Information Finder üåç

This project is a **City Information Finder** web application that fetches and displays detailed information about a city. Users can input the name of a country, state, and city, and get data including AQI, weather conditions, timezone, sunrise and sunset times, and famous places nearby.  

This application demonstrates the power of RESTful APIs and integrates multiple third-party APIs for fetching real-time data.
